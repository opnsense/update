.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility offers combined kernel and base system upgrades using
remotely fetched binary sets, as well as package upgrades via
.Xr pkg 8 .
.Pp
Options
.Sq Fl b ,
.Sq Fl k ,
.Sq Fl p
and
.Sq Fl t
may be stacked to create selective updates using
a minor update sequence.
Typically,
.Sq Fl bkp
is used to update all currently installed components at once.
.Pp
Major upgrades are invoked using
.Sq Fl u
instead and default to
.Sq Fl bkp
unless otherwise specified.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl m Ar mirror_url" -offset indent
.It Fl A Ar mirror_abi
Change the set fetch and package release ABI to
.Ar mirror_abi .
.It Fl a Ar abi_hint
Change the
.Ar abi_hint
from the detected default
.Pq output of Sq opnsense-verify Fl a
to a specific value.
If a subdirectory is appended,
.Fl A Ar mirror_abi
is emulated for it but not written to the configuration.
Thus it does not affect
.Sq Fl p .
.It Fl B
Execute single-step base system upgrade after use of
.Sq Fl u .
Implies
.Sq Fl f .
.It Fl b
Select the base system.
Implies
.Sq Fl C .
.It Fl C
Perform the base system obsolete file cleanup.
.It Fl c
Check whether a set update can be performed, but do not install it.
When using
.Sq Fl p ,
the major upgrade hint file is checked for existence only.
.It Fl D Ar device
Device type for the kernel to be loaded.
If unset it is automatically detected.
.It Fl d
Restore the repository defaults.
.It Fl e
Empty the cache directory.
.It Fl f
Force an update even when the latest release is already installed.
.It Fl G
Return the log file of the last upgrade.
Since upgrades run without network connectivity and user
interaction there is no direct way to observe it other than
an attached console or monitor which can still miss important
context.
.It Fl i
Ignore the signature verification result.
Otherwise, the
.Xr opnsense-verify 8
utility is used to verify a set signature.
The default is off meaning secure, unless the package mirror
configuration does not use fingerprints.
.It Fl K
Execute single-step kernel set upgrade after use of
.Sq Fl u .
Implies
.Sq Fl f .
.It Fl k
Select the kernel.
.It Fl L
Lock a set to avoid updates.
The lock will be stripped by
.Sq Fl U
or
.Sq Fl u ,
and ignored temporarily by
.Sq Fl f .
.It Fl l Ar directory
Instead of downloading, point to a local directory where sets are located.
.It Fl M
Return the full release URL of the selected mirror.
.It Fl m Ar mirror_url
Change the set fetch and package location to
.Ar mirror_url .
.It Fl n Ar mirror_dir
Change the mirror directory to
.Ar mirror_dir .
If no slash character is preset the default release ABI is inserted for
backwards compatibility.
.It Fl O
Return the packages mirror configuration.
.It Fl P
Execute single-step packages upgrade after use of
.Sq Fl u .
Implies
.Sq Fl f .
.It Fl p
Select the packages.
.It Fl R
Select the major release from the upgrade hint file if found.
Otherwise,
.Sq unknown
is used to signify the hint is missing and the major update
cannot be reached.
.It Fl r Ar release
Select the
.Ar release
to be installed.
Package upgrades are unaffected by this option when not using
.Sq Fl u .
.It Fl s
Skip update phase; useful in conjunction with
.Sq Fl m
and
.Sq Fl n .
.It Fl S
Return the download size of the requested remote set.
.It Fl T
Probe the lock status of the requested set,
exiting with an error if the respective set is locked.
.It Fl t Ar type
Switch to the release package
.Ar type ,
properly handling the
.Xr pkg 8
.Sq vital
flag transition.
The
.Xr opnsense-version 8
utility is used to test which version is currently installed.
.It Fl U
Unlock a set to allow updates.
Sets are generally unlocked unless
.Sq Fl L
was used.
.It Fl u
Invoke the major upgrade if known or set manually using
.Sq Fl r Ar release .
In order to finish the upgrade,
.Sq Fl B
and
.Sq Fl P
must be invoked in this particular order, accompanied by a reboot
after each individual step.
.It Fl V
Set debug mode for shell script output.
.It Fl v
Print the latest set version.
.It Fl x
Return the subscription key if it exists in the release URL.
.It Fl z
Use the snapshot directory to fetch sets regardless of what is
currently configured in the repository file.
This does not affect
.Sq Fl p .
