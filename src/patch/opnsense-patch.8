.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility treats all arguments as upstream
.Xr git 1
repository commit hashes, downloads them with
.Xr fetch 1
and finally applies them in order using
.Xr patch 1 .
.Pp
A preprocess run will remove repository meta data file changes,
only keep file modifications inside the
.Pa src
directory and adjust file names and prefix accordingly.
A postprocess run will retain file permissions which are stored
inside a special format in
.Xr git 1
patches.
.Pp
After successful apply the browser cache will be invalidated,
but the system may still need manual interaction to make the
changes functional.
A reboot is the cleanest option if there are no immediate
results visible.
.Pp
Patches can also be reversed by reapplying them, but multiple
patches must be given in reverse order to succeed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl c Ar repo_default" -offset indent
.It Fl a Ar account
Set the
.Ar account
name of the fetch URL.
.It Fl c Ar repo_default
Use a preconfigured prefix, repository and patch level.
The known options are
.Sq core
.Pq default ,
.Sq installer ,
.Sq plugins
and
.Sq update .
.It Fl d
Download the requested patch, but do not apply it.
.It Fl e
Remove all patches stored in the cache directory.
Note this will ignore the
.Sq Fl r
option and instead delete patches from all repositories immediately.
.It Fl f
Force a fetch of the patch to be applied even when it is
already stored in the cache directory.
.It Fl i
Insecure mode trusts the remote patch origin.
.It Fl l
List all patches stored in the cache directory.
.It Fl N
Do not reverse patches.
Similar to
.Xr patch 1
.Sq Fl N
mode.
.It Fl P Ar prefix_dir
Set the prefix directory for performing patches.
.It Fl p Ar patch_level
Set the
.Sq Fl p
argument of
.Xr patch 1
to the respective value.
.It Fl r Ar repository
Set the
.Ar repository
name of the fetch URL.
.It Fl s Ar site

.Ar site
of the fetch URL.
